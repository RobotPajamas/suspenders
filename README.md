# Suspenders

Suspenders is a (very) alpha VS Code extension to provide [Pants](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants) users with some quality-of-workflow improvements.

The extension is loaded upon there being a `pants.toml` file in the workspace root.

## Available Functionality

Suspenders functionality is very limited at the moment.

The preliminary aims are related to streamlining [project introspection](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/project-introspection) by creating a view container which shows source roots, targets, etc.

In addition, the command palette has been enhanced with several pants specific commands:

- Run `check` goal on all targets
- Run `fmt` goal on all targets
- Run `lint` goal on all targets
- Run `test` goal on all targets
